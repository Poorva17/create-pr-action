# create-pr-action



A Github Action which automatically creates pull request (PR) from one branch against another branch if it is ahead of another branch
HEAD_BRANCH - branch to raise PR from
BASE_BRANCH - branch against which PR is raised

For example, if you want to pull in `release` branch changes into `main` then, HEAD_BRANCH is `release` and BASE_BRANCH is `main`.

Code owner's / reviewers can then merge this PR with usual flow.

## Usecase
This action can be used to keep any two branches in sync. For example, if you have development branch (let's say master or main) 
and release branch (let's say release) then any hotfixes pushed to release branch should also be merged to development branch.
This plugin automatically creates PR from specified HEAD_BRANCH against BASE_BRANCH if HEAD_BRANCH is ahead of BASE_BRANCH.

## Usage

Following example show usage of action to create PR from release (HEAD_BRANCH) against main (BASE_BRANCH)
```yaml
name: Create PR

on:  [push]

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Create PR
        uses: poorva17/create-pr-action@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          HEAD_BRANCH: development
          BASE_BRANCH: main
```
## Workflow

1. Add this action to your repo.
1. Push changes to HEAD_BRANCH (ex: hotfixes to release branch)
1. This action creates PR from HEAD_BRANCH against BASE_BRANCH. If PR has zero file changes, then PR is auto closed.


## Roadmap for upcoming versions of this action
1. Integrate slack to notify repository owners about PR.
1. Feature for Cross repository PRs.
1. Feature to create PRs against multiple branches
